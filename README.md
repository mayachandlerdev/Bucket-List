# bucketList

Git clone this file and write "npm install" in your terminal.

This is a bucket list application that works with both the front and back end. The user has the ability to input what they'd like on their bucket list and they have the option to click on it when they've completed it. Their item will then filter to their list of completed tasks and display with a strikethrough.
